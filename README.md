# MEAN-Todo

The purpose of this project is to get more practice creating a full-stack application using the MEAN stack.  As I go through this project, I am outlining the steps I go through so I have a guideline for future MEAN stack projects.  The outline is available on a Trello board I created [here](https://trello.com/b/WIzAMmMx/mean-stack-checklist)
